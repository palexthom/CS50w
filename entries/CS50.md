**CS50** (**Computer Science 50**) is an on-campus and online introductory course on computer science taught at Harvard University and, as of 2015, Yale University as well. In 2016, CS50 became available to high school students as an AP courseThe course material is available online for free on EdX with a range of certificates available for a fee. The on-campus version is Harvard's largest class with 800 students, 102 staff and up to 2,200 participants in their regular hackathons.

After a participant has completed CS50, there are several follow on programs including [CS50 Computer Science for Web Programming](https://cs50.harvard.edu/web/2020/), CS50 Computer science for Artificial Intelligence, CS50 Computer Science for Game Development and CS50 Computer Science and Mobile Apps. These programs are all available on the EdX platform.

CS50 lectures are recorded and uploaded to several services including iTunes U, EdX, and YouTube. Additional video "walkthroughs" are recorded with professors and volunteer students. Course questions, called problem sets, or "psets" for short, are available in both PDF and HTML format. Students can upload problem set answers, and some questions are graded by automation. Students can also use special software to check their code in the cloud. In 2016, CS50 became the first university course to offer students the possibility to watch all lectures entirely in virtual reality.
