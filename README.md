# cs50w

This course picks up where CS50 leaves off, diving more deeply into the design and implementation of web apps with Python, JavaScript, and SQL using frameworks like Flask, Django, and Bootstrap.

Topics include database design, scalability, security, and user experience. Through hands-on projects, you'll learn to write and use APIs, create interactive UIs, and leverage cloud services like GitHub and Heroku. By course's end, you'll emerge with knowledge and experience in principles, languages, and tools that empower you to design and deploy applications on the Internet.

Each branch in this repository is a project from this class, and each has a readme file with the specification for that project. There is also a video demonstration for each of the projects.
